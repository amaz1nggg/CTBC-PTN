Research on Automated Classification Methods for Multi-Attribute Interdisciplinary Literature—— Community Strength-Based Three-Branch Contrast Pseudo-twin Networks

In this paper, we introduce an innovative literature categorization method that combines the concept of community strength with data enhancement methods to construct a twin network structure containing three branches. By introducing the community strength concept, the feature representation of the literature categorization task is successfully enhanced. Meanwhile, an end-to-end learning framework is designed, aiming to simplify the model training process, thus improving the overall training efficiency and realizing the automated classification of literature. Experiments demonstrate that the method performs more superiorly compared to other models on the Wiki-CS dataset, with a maximum accuracy of 78.64%. This result further validates the effectiveness of the graph representation learning strategy that incorporates node attributes and community information. The method in this paper injects new ideas into the field of literature categorization and has a wide range of application prospect.
